## SPA Authentication

The CRM API is secured with [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum) so that the React single-page application can authenticate without compromising the existing role model. The key pieces of the flow are:

- **CSRF protection** – Before attempting a credentialed request from a browser-based client, call `GET /sanctum/csrf-cookie` to prime the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie and then include the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header on subsequent state-changing requests. This keeps SPA interactions aligned with Laravel's built-in CSRF middleware.
- **Token exchange** – Submit `POST /api/auth/login` with a `user_name`, `password`, and optional `device_name`. Successful authentication issues a Sanctum personal access token whose abilities mirror the user's assigned roles and permissions.
- **Token storage** – Store the bearer token in memory (for example, React context) or another secure storage mechanism that is not accessible to third-party scripts. Attach it to the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all API calls that are not guarded by cookies.
- **Refresh cadence** – Tokens expire after the number of minutes configured in `SANCTUM_TOKEN_EXPIRATION` (default 120). Use `POST /api/auth/refresh` before expiry to rotate the currently active token without forcing users to log in again.
- **Logout** – Call `POST /api/auth/logout` to revoke the active token on the device. Tokens are also rotated automatically on refresh.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
